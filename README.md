# linkedListc
Made a doubly linkedList class with useful member functions using structs as nodes in C++. The nodes can hold any value via templates.
## also included a test file that tests all the member functions which you can compile using:
### g++ testLinkList.cpp -o testLinkList.exe
## run it using:
### ./testLinkList.exe
